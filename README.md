I started this repo a long time ago to implement various Data structures as part of my Uni
and as interview prep, I never got around to doing most of them, but nevertheless, I have 
this repo as a catch-all of all of the small projects I have been doing.

In here you will find 
1. A JSON parser written using a Parser Combinator style
2. A boyer moore algorith implementation
3. A Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm implementation
4. A Thomson NFA implementation for constructing NFAs out of Regexes
5. An AVL implementation (both recursive and iterative) in Zig
